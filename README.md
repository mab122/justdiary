I really liked using [jrnl.sh](http://jrnl.sh/), but I didn't like storing ALL of my entries in one freaking text file I prefer something like [Diary](https://github.com/billthefarmer/diary) app uses (this why I would also could sync my phone with my pc).

This is essentialy no bullshit script that mimicks *jrnl*.
